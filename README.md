🧬 Predict Disease Outcome Based on Genetic and Clinical Data
This dataset has been created for a machine learning project focused on predicting disease outcomes using a combination of genetic markers and clinical features. The aim is to explore how both genomic and clinical parameters can be used to build predictive models for early diagnosis, treatment response, or prognosis.

📂 Dataset Overview
Project Title: Predict Disease Outcome Based on Genetic and Clinical Data

Format: CSV / Excel

Number of Samples: [Insert Number]

Number of Features: [Insert Number]

Target Variable: Disease Outcome (e.g., Positive / Negative, Recovered / Not Recovered)

🔬 Features
The dataset contains two types of features:

1. Genetic Data
Includes gene expressions or SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) relevant to the disease.
Example columns:

GENE_A, GENE_B, GENE_C, ...

Mutation Status (Mutated / Wild Type)

Expression levels

2. Clinical Data
Includes standard health and medical records.
Example columns:

Age

Sex

Blood Pressure

Cholesterol

BMI

Smoking Status

Family History

🎯 Target Variable
Disease Outcome: A binary or multi-class label representing the presence or progression of a specific disease (e.g., cancer recurrence, diabetes risk, cardiovascular events).

💡 Use Cases
Predictive modeling (classification/regression)

Feature importance and interpretability

Data visualization and correlation analysis

Integration of omics and clinical datasets

🛠️ Applications
Healthcare AI

Personalized medicine

Bioinformatics research

Early disease detection
